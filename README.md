ReplayParser
============

This is a advanced version of the Dota parser developed by Bruno@DotaAcademy. The first part of this program includes re-parse the replay data, make player statistics available for other usage, visualize statistics and provide a user GUI. The second part of this project would be machine learning for match winning rates by using SVM model.

This project is basically finished besides some trimming and coding improvements. Some Euler training and data structure algorithm training need to be done before I revisited this one.
